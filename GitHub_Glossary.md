##  GitHub Glossary


**Branch**: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but can be edited without changing the primary, or master branch. After you’ve made the desired changes, you merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes. 

**Clone**: A clone is a local copy of a repository that exists on your computer as opposed to on some online server. You can edit cloned files in your editor of choice and use Git to track your changes offline.

**Command Line**: The computer program used to input Git commands. On a Mac, it’s called Terminal. The command line allows users to input text-based commands rather than using a mouse.

**Commit**: A commit is essentially just a revision; a change to a file or set of files. GitHub tracks these commits so that you can keep a record of what changes were made when and by whom. Commits are typically paired with a commit message that briefly describes the change(s) made.

**Diff**: A diff is the difference in changes between two commits. Diffs visually illustrate the latest revision with additions highlighted in green and deletions in red.

**Fork**: A fork is a personal copy of another user’s repository that exists on your GitHub account. You can freely make changes to a forked repository without affecting the original. Forks remain tied to the original, so by sending a pull request, you can ask the original user to update the repository with your changes.

**Git**: Git is an open source program that tracks changes made to files. It is the core technology that GitHub is built on top of.

**Pull Request**: A pull request is a proposed change to a repository submitted by a user that is accepted or rejected by the repository’s owners. Like commits, pull requests are typically titled and contain a brief descriptive message.

**Repository**: A repository (repo) can be easily understood as a project’s folder. A repo contains all of the project’s files and tracks each file’s commit history. Repositories can have multiple owners, or collaborators, and can be either public or private.
